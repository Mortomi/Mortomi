- I'm mortomi.
- I like game development, and interesting stories.
- Collaboration may not be my strongsuit, but I try to make everything I write legible.
- I may be a beginner, but I learn every day. Every failure fuels you, and most important about stuff like this is that you stay determined.
- anyway enjoy anything I might upload here.
